### General info

What I learned in the course was what scrum is, and the components and features of this agile framework. I learned about the members of a scrum team and their different responsibilities, as well as the events that occur within this framework and who participates in these events. No code was made in this course so only the concepts learned in the course are found.

### Things learned
- What an agile methodology is. Agile software development refers to  software development methodologies centered round the idea of iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.

- Differences between traditional and agile developments. Agile strategies have smaller groups and shorter development periods called sprints. These sprints allow to present functional parts of the project to the client, allowing to receive feedback and work less in the end. 

- Agile manifesto:

> We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan
> 
That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.


- 12 agile principles.
>- #1 Satisfy Customers Through Early & Continuous Delivery
>- #2 Welcome Changing Requirements Even Late in the Project
>- #3 Deliver Value Frequently
>- #4 Break the Silos of Your Project
>- #5 Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals
>- #6 The Most Effective Way of Communication is Face-to-face
>- #7 Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress
>- #8 Maintain a Sustainable Working Pace
>- #9 Continuous Excellence Enhances Agility
>- #10 Simplicity is Essential
>- #11 Self-organizing Teams Generate Most Value
>- #12 Regularly Reflect and Adjust Your Way of Work to Boost Effectiveness

- What scrum is. Scrum is a framework by which people can address complex adaptive problems, while delivering products of the highest possible value in productively and creatively ways.

- The pillars of scrum.
>- #1 Transparency. This means presenting the facts as they are. This will create trust. 
>- #2 Inspection. The team openly and transparently shows the product at the end of each Sprint to the customer in order to gather valuable feedback. 
>- #3 Adaptation. Continuous improvement, the ability to adapt based on the results of the inspection.

- Scrum values.
>- #1 Courage
>- #2 Commitment
>- #3 Openness
>- #4 Respect
>- #5 Focus

- The scrum team members (product owner, scrum master, development team).

- Product owner functions and responsibilities. 
>- Ensures user stories are “ready” for development to start work.
>- Ensures each story has the correct acceptance criteria.
>- Gathers, manages, and prioritizes the product backlog.
>- Ensures close collaboration with the development team.
>- Tracks progress towards the release of a product.
>- Define customer needs and the associated features to meet those needs.

- Scrum master functions and responsibilities.
>- Implement Project Management/Best Practices
>- Keep all Parties on Track and Informed.
>- Solve blocker that the the team members may have.
>- Introduce Agile Engineering Practices.

- Development team functions, responsibilities and characteristics.
>- Perform Sprint Execution.
>- Inspect and Adapt.
>- Groom the Product Backlog.
>- Plant de sprint.

- Iterations (sprints). A predifined cycle of work.

- Scrum events (sprint retrospective, sprint planning, refinement).
>- Sprint retrospective: 3 questions. What did we do right?. What went wrong?. What can be improved?. Used to search solutions and improve.
>- Sprint planning: As the name implies, this is where sprint planning happens.
>- Refinement: Analizing the current sprint to refine next sprints and increase performance.

- What epics and backlogs are.

- User histories and its components (title, description, points, acceptance criteria).

- To estimate user's histories.

- To define priorities.

- Measurement of project progress. 

- What daily stand up is and how it's performed.

- Daily stand up three questions (what did I do yesterday?, what am I going to do today?, Do I have any blockers?).

- Sprint review.

- Escalability. Scrum strategie can work with bigger teams.

- Communities of practice. Organized groups of people who have a common interest in a specific technical or business domain. They collaborate regularly to share information, improve their skills, and actively work on advancing the general knowledge of the domain.
